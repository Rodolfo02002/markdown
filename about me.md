<h2><strong>How did i get here? </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">I got to Franklin D Roosevelt after completing W.E. Greiner Exploratory Arts Academy middle school. I had no idea to what school to go to so i just went to the one near my school i just so happens to be the my current school. When i came to Franklin D Roosevelt, There i was "dragged" into a so called collegiate academy, just because i tough it was rude to say no. I am planning on just focusing on my future .</p>

<h2><strong>What are things that interest me?</strong></h2>
Some of the thing that catch my attention is good music such as the good song writer <span style="color: #ff0000;">T</span><span style="color: #00ff00;">e</span><span style="color: #ff00ff;">k</span><span style="color: #3366ff;">a</span>s<span style="color: #ffff00;">h</span><span style="color: #000080;">i</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">69</span>.He makes a good amount of songs. Some of my favorite foods are fajita asada, this is a traditional type of dish. This is a shame because i have braces and i no longer can eat it, That and tortillas. Other interest include relaxing, because i like to be calm and not rushed. I have 2 favorite colors, these are black and red. These two colors are the best. And they are all out my favorite. Cars what can i say they fascinate me especially the 1979 !0th year anniversary trans am, that thing is a beauty. It is a very strong, aerodynamic and made out of all metal, its a great american mussel car. This car will be my future car. I just cant wait till i can drive it. I will fix this car all up and be one with it. Finally i enjoy gaming with my brother, he is fun and i like his style.
