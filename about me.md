<strong>Who am I?</strong></h2>
Hi my name is Rodolfo Emilio Manriquez, my first name was given to me by my father Jose Rodolfo Manriquez. I am a smart and sarcastic person. i was born in a hospital near down town Dallas,Tx. Through the beginning of my life i wasen't all that smart i used to get low grades all until 7th grade when something snapped in me, after that i started to understand more things, i started to question the why in every thing.  Some of the foods i like is mostly tacos especially the ones my dad makes, they some how Just taste magically good. A few places i would like to visit include Iceland, because it seems peaceful i have seen some landscape pictures and the colors just seem vibrant, The second place i would most defensively like to go to would be Alaska, this because i love the cold weather.
<h2><strong>What do i want to do with my future?</strong></h2>
That is a great question, I would probably like to be a grower but not any type of grower, a medicinal marijuana grower. I Say this because the economy and how its going there is a booming in that department. I don't know much about it but i would love to learn more about it. I will try my very best to finish college and then i'm planing on moving to different states in order to learn more. If this dose not work out i would like to become a mechanic or an electrician and help my dad out. I cant really predict the futures outcome, but i can do my bet to try and make it happen by focusing on the present.

<h2><strong>How did i get here? </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">I got to Franklin D Roosevelt after completing W.E. Greiner Exploratory Arts Academy middle school. I had no idea to what school to go to so i just went to the one near my school i just so happens to be the my current school. When i came to Franklin D Roosevelt, There i was "dragged" into a so called collegiate academy, just because i tough it was rude to say no. I am planning on just focusing on my future .</p>

<h2><strong>What are things that interest me?</strong></h2>
Some of the thing that catch my attention is good music such as the good song writer <span style="color: #ff0000;">T</span><span style="color: #00ff00;">e</span><span style="color: #ff00ff;">k</span><span style="color: #3366ff;">a</span>s<span style="color: #ffff00;">h</span><span style="color: #000080;">i</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">69</span>.He makes a good amount of songs. Some of my favorite foods are fajita asada, this is a traditional type of dish. This is a shame because i have braces and i no longer can eat it, That and tortillas. Other interest include relaxing, because i like to be calm and not rushed. I have 2 favorite colors, these are black and red. These two colors are the best. And they are all out my favorite. Cars what can i say they fascinate me especially the 1979 !0th year anniversary trans am, that thing is a beauty. It is a very strong, aerodynamic and made out of all metal, its a great american mussel car. This car will be my future car. I just cant wait till i can drive it. I will fix this car all up and be one with it. Finally i enjoy gaming with my brother, he is fun and i like his style.
